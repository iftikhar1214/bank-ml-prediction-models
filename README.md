# bank-ml-prediction-models
This project analyzes a real-world banking dataset to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. We applied multiple machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM (various kernels)—and compared their performance using accuracy and visualizations. Includes full data cleaning, feature encoding, and model evaluation.
